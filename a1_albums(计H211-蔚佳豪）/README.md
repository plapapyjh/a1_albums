# CP1404 at XUT Assignment 1 - Albums

Assignment 1 for XUT, IT@JCU

By: **蔚佳豪**

This directory contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
(`albums_backup.csv` is to copy from in case you delete the contents of `albums.csv` and want the original data back).  
**Edit this README file**, replacing this paragraph with your own assignment name, and update any details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace
the `answer...` parts).

1. How long did the entire assignment 1 project take you?

> Two days.

2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?

> I need to learn and practice more to lay a good foundation.
